# Internetworking-IK1552

## Course contents

* What Internet is and why it has turned out be so successfully.
* Protocols that are required for Internet technique (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc).
* TCP/IP-protocol stack, layer, encapsulation and multiplexing
* IP-addressing, subnetting and resolution
* Transport protocols including UDP and TCP.
* Details for routing and routning procols (RIP, BGP, OSPF)
* Autoconfiguration and naming (BOOTP, DHCP, DNS)
* Internet applications (VoIP, SMTP, etc).
* Multicasting, VPN, Mobile IP and safety.
* IPv6 and certain differences with IPv4.

## Intended learning outcomes
After passing the course, the student shall be able to

* give an account of the principles that the Internet technique is based on and that define Internet.
* give an account of TCP/IP-protocol stack, layer, encapsulation and multiplexing
* give an account of multiplexing demultiplexing, upward and downward multiplexing
* give an account of encapsulation that is used for mobile IP, virtual private networks (VPN), IP security and other tunnelling protocols
*give an account of how information is coded in headings and how the choice of this encoding and field size can influence the use and the evolution of a protocol
* give an account of how data are coded in the package and how this can influence the Internet technique particularly in the presence of firewall and network address translators.
* account for IP-addressing, subnetting and adress resolution including interaction between protocols across layers
* give an account of protocols for higher layers including security threats and performance limitations for each
* give an account of the basic details for routing and routing protocols (RIP, BGP, OSPF) - with an emphasis on their limitations and behaviors.
* account for autoconfiguration and naming (BOOTP, DHCP, DNS, DDNS, DNSsec, ENUM, etc), with an emphasis on risks, limitations, scaling and evolution.
* give an account of the nature and pressures on the design and operation of internets, particularly on scaling, performance and delay bounds, due to new Internet applications (VoIP, streaming, game, peer-to-peer, etc)
* give an account of advantages and disadvantages with IPv6 compared with IPv4.
* read and extract information from current literature in the form of conference papers in the area.
* describe and explain the field of Internet technique by writing a text that is appropriate as contribution to a national conference in the area.

in order to

* obtain practical and general knowledge of the protocols that form the basis for Internet.
* obtain good knowledge of internet protocol and architecture for Internet technique.
* be able to read research and standardization documents.
